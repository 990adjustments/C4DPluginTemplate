C4DPluginTemplate
=========

Description
-----------

Starting template for Maxon Cinema 4D Plugins. 
Specifically, a command type plugin. Adjust to taste. This includes
some of the information I use for my own plugins so make sure to
adjust accordingly.

Also, remember to get a final ID over at
[plugincafe.com](http://www.plugincafe.com/). The ID in the template
is just for testing purposes.

Installation & Usage
--------------------

Just fill in the blanks and place in your Cinema 4D plugins directory.
